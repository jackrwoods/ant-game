# Avarus (ant-game)

Avarus is an RTS game engine project that I started working on in the summer of 2016 (after high school). Currently, up to 8,000 individual
ants can be rendered in real time on my Toshiba Chromebook 2 (running Linux) at 60fps. I plan on returning to the project when I have more
time, and have gained more programming/code design experience.
